# Detection-of-phishing-SMS-using-ML
Detection of phishing SMS using ML

This project focuses on classifying SMS messages as spam or ham using machine learning techniques. The notebook includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.

# Features:
1. Data Cleaning: Removing common words, stemming, and eliminating unwanted punctuations and symbols.
2. WordCloud Visualization: Visual representation of spam and ham messages.

# Machine Learning Models Used:
1. Naive Bayes Classifiers:
   a. Multinomial Naive Bayes
   b.Gaussian Naive Bayes
   c. Bernoulli Naive Bayes

2. Decision Tree Classifier

3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# Performance Evaluation: 
Comparing different classifiers to determine the best approach for spam detection.

#Requirements:
1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Scikit-learn
4. Pandas
5. Matplotlib
6. Seaborn

# How to Use:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Open the notebook and run the cells step by step.
